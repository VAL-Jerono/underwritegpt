"In light of the applicant's profile as a 37-year-old driver with a 1.2-year-old vehicle and an eleven-month subscription, we recommend monitoring this policy. While the location is rural and there are two airbags, the absence of electronic stability control (ESC) contributes to a higher risk score of 36.6%. The top risk factor is the subscription, which accounts for 30.0% of the overall risk. Our analysis of twenty similar cases indicates that there have been three filed claims, resulting in a claim rate of 15.0%, significantly higher than the baseline rate of 6.4%. As such, we will closely monitor this policy to assess whether further action is necessary. If necessary, we will adjust the premium accordingly. We encourage our colleagues to support us in ensuring that we provide the best possible coverage for our clients while mitigating potential risks."
