"We recommend approving your application with monitoring due to its overall risk score of 36.6%, which is slightly above the average for similar cases where we've filed claims at a rate of 15% compared to our baseline of 6.4%. While you are currently on a 9-month subscription, this has been identified as your top risk factor contributing significantly to that score with an additional 30% risk associated specifically due to the shorter term commitment in rural areas where monitoring can be especially beneficial for us and our applicants alike. Your vehicle is only two years old without electronic stability control (ESC), which, despite being a newer model equipped with airbags, does not fully mitigate this risk profile given your driving location and subscription length. As we move forward, please be aware that if you continue to maintain these conditions or choose similar options in the future, monitoring will remain an integral part of our relationship moving ahead"
